## DSC Mock Interview

This package is used by the Waterloo Data Science Club for Data Science and Machine Learning mock interviews.

It contains toy datasets that interviewers can use to ask candidates to query and analyze.

The goal of this interview is to work with the data in various ways. Some potential goals are:
1. Cleaning the data.
2. Gain insights about the stats about Pokemon, perhaps through data visualization.
3. Build a classifier that can determine if a Pokemon is legendary or not.
4. Demonstrate abilities to write complex SQL queries.

The interviewer can use this dataset to suit their needs. In the author's opinion, no python knowledge is required for this interview (the interviewer is free to assist with language help, such as explaining the use of popular functions).
